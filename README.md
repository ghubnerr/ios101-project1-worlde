# Project 1 - *Wordle*

Submitted by: **Gabriel Lucchesi**

**Wordle** is a mobile app that generates a random word that you have to guess with every different round. You have some guesses to get it right, and with every guess, you're given hints as to whether the letters that you tried on the board are either:
  1) Not on the target word
  2) On the target word, but on the wrong location
  3) Correctly in place in the target word

Time spent: **0.8** hours spent in total

## Notes

My difficulties were in understanding how the structure beneath UI and all the other built-in methods interacted with the inputs and user interface.
